# aviary
Modern Twitter/X tweak for iOS/iPadOS/macOS, focused on stability

This tweak is made to be modular and comes in 3 flavors, which can be specified at compile:

`aviary-base` - This is the base tweak, for use with the stock Twitter/X client.

`aviary-nfb` - For use with NeoFreeBird, use this if you're building it from scratch.

`aviary-legacy` - For use on legacy Twitter versions (v7.0-9.x), includes neccesary patches to get those versions working.
